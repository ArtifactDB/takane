# Miscellaneous validators for ArtifactDB 

## Overview

This library contains some C++ libraries to validate ArtifactDB file formats that aren't covered by other libraries
(e.g., [**comservatory**](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/comservatory), [**uzuki2**](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/uzuki2)).
The idea is to provide a cross-language method for validating the files - 
which is not quite as useful as a library for _reading_ the files, but it's better than nothing.
