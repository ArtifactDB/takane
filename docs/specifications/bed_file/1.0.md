# BED file (1.0)

## Overview

The `bed_file` format specifies the expected representation for a BED file.

## Object metadata

The `OBJECT` file should contain a `bed_file` property, itself a JSON object with the following properties:

- `version`, a string specifying the version of the `bed_file` format.
  This should be set to "1.0".
- `indexed`, a boolean indicating whether the BED file has been indexed.

## Directory structure

If `indexed = false`, the directory should contain `file.bed.gz`, a Gzip-compressed BED file.
The file should be formatted as described in the [BED specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/BEDv1.pdf).

If `indexed = true`, the directory should contain `file.bed.bgz`, a BGZF-compressed BED file. 
The directory should also contain `file.bed.bgz.tbi`, a [Tabix file ](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/tabix.pdf) that indexes `file.bed.bgz`.
