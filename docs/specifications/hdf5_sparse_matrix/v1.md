# HDF5 sparse matrix

## Overview

A compressed sparse matrix stored inside a group of a HDF5 file, corresponding to the [`hdf5_sparse_matrix`](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/BiocObjectSchemas/raw/master/raw/hdf5_sparse_matrix/v1.json) schema.
We use `~` below to denote properties of the schema.

The main HDF5 group containing the contents of the matrix is taken from `~hdf5_sparse_matrix.group`.
This group may have a `version` property containing a scalar `<major>.<minor>` version string.
If a version attibute is present on `group`, all version-related properties in the schema (e.g., `~hdf5_sparse_matrix.version`) will be ignored in the remainder of this document.

If `~hdf5_sparse_matrix.format` is equal to `"tenx_matrix"`, `indices` should contain row indices and `indptr` should contain the column index pointers. 
The group should also contain a `shape` dataset, an 1-dimensional integer dataset of length 2 storing the number of rows and columns - this should be equal to `array.dimensions`.

**If a `version` attribute is present on the main group:**
the group should contain a `format` string scalar attribute, equal to `~hdf5_sparse_matrix.format`.

## Datatypes 

`data` should be a 1-dimensional integer or floating-point dataset containing the values of the non-zero elements.
The type of the matrix is specified by `~array.type` and should be integer, boolean or numeric.
The exact type is generally left to the discretion of the data generator, with some restrictions:

- A number matrix should be represented by any integer or floating-point `data`.
  - **If a `version` attribute is present on the main group:** 
    the HDF5 datatype should be a subset of a 64-bit float.
    See the [HDF5 policy draft (0.1.0)](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/Bioc-HDF5-policy/tree/0.1.0) for more details.
- An integer matrix should be represented by an integer `data`.
  - **If a `version` attribute is present on the main group:** 
    the datatype should be a subset of a 32-bit signed integer.
- A boolean matrix can be represented by an integer `data`, where a value of 1 is truthy and a value of zero is falsey.
  - **If a `version` attribute is present on the main group:** 
    the datatype should be a subset of a 32-bit signed integer.

`indices` should be a 1-dimensional integer dataset containing the 0-based row/column index for each non-zero element in `data`.
`indptr` should be a 1-dimensional integer dataset of length equal to the number of columns/rows plus 1, containing pointers to the start and end of each column/row.

**If a `version` attribute is present on the main group:** 
the HDF5 datatype of `indices` and `indptr` should be a subset of a 64-bit unsigned integer.
Note that these two datasets do not need to have the same exact datatype.

**If a `version` attribute is present on the main group:** 
the `shape` datatype should be a subset of a 64-bit signed integer when `~hdf5_sparse_matrix.format` is `"tenx_matrix"`.

## Missing values

**If a `version` attribute is present on the main group:** 
the `data` dataset may have a `missing-value-placeholder` attribute, containing a scalar value to use as a missing value placeholder.
Any value equal to this placeholder should be treated as missing.
The HDF5 datatype of the attribute should be exactly equal to that of the dataset.
For number matrices, the scalar value may be NaN, in which case all NaNs in the dataset are treated as missing regardless of the payload.
If no attribute exists, it can be assumed that no values are missing.
See the [HDF5 policy draft (0.1.0)](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/Bioc-HDF5-policy/tree/0.1.0) for more details.

**Otherwise:**
the handling of missing values is determined by `~hdf5_sparse_matrix.version`:
- **For `~hdf5_sparse_matrix.version = 2`:** 
  the `data` dataset may have a `missing-value-placeholder` attribute, containing a scalar value to use as a missing value placeholder.
  Any value equal to this placeholder should be treated as missing.
  The HDF5 datatype of the attribute should be exactly equal to that of the dataset.
  For numbers, the scalar value may be NaN with a non-default payload, which should be considered via byte-wise comparisons, e.g., with `memcmp`.
  If no attribute exists, it can be assumed that no values are missing.
- **For `~hdf5_sparse_matrix.version = 1`:** 
  Missing integers and booleans are represented by -2147483648.
  Missing numbers are represented by a quiet NaN with a payload of 1954.

## Dimension names

**If a `version` attribute is present on the main group:** 
the main group should have a `dimnames` attribute, which should be a string dataset of length 2.
The first and second entries should contain names of the string datasets containing the row and column names, respectively.
Either entry may also be an empty string in which case it can be assumed that no names were present for that dimension.
Each dataset lies in the same HDF5 file, can be of any string datatype, and should be of length equal to the corresponding dimension.

**Otherwise:**
The `~hdf5_sparse_matrix.dimnames` property should be present and contain the name of a separate group containing the dimnames.
This group should contain zero or one string datasets for each dimension. 
The name of each string dataset is based on its dimension - `"0"` for rows, `"1"` for columns - and should have length equal to the extent of that dimension.
If no dataset is not present for a dimension, it can be assumed that no dimnames are available for that dimension.

## Example usage

```cpp
#include "takane/takane.hpp"

takane::hdf5_sparse_matrix::Parameters params(group_name, { 10, 20 });
params.type = takane::array::Type::BOOLEAN;

takane::hdf5_sparse_matrix::validate(file_path, params);
```
