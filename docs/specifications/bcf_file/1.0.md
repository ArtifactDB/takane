# BCF file (1.0)

## Overview

The `bcf_file` format specifies the expected representation for a BCF file.

## Object metadata

The `OBJECT` file should contain a `bcf_file` property, itself a JSON object with the following properties:

- `version`, a string specifying the version of the `bcf_file` format.
  This should be set to "1.0".

## Directory structure

The directory should contain `file.bcf`, the BCF file.
The file should be formatted as described in the BCF specification - 
any version is supported, but it is generally recommended to use [version 2 or higher](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/BCFv2_qref.pdf).

The directory may optionally contain `file.bcf.tbi` and/or `file.bcf.csi`, which should be indices into `file.bcf`.
`file.bcf.tbi` should follow the format described in the [Tabix specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/tabix.pdf),
while `file.bcf.csi` should follow the [CSI specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/CSIv1.pdf).
Both files may be present in a single directory, though it is generally only necessary to provide one.
